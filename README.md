# Hi, I'm Ramakrishna Chavali 👋

Data Engineer specializing in Google Cloud Platform and modern data infrastructure. I build scalable data platforms, analytics applications, and automated pipelines that bridge the gap between data engineering and full-stack development.

## About Me

I'm a data engineer with deep expertise in Google Cloud Platform, currently transitioning into full-stack development to build end-to-end data products. My focus is on creating production-ready systems that are both technically robust and user-friendly.

**What drives me:**
- Building elegant solutions to complex data problems
- Creating self-service data platforms that empower teams
- Automating infrastructure and reducing manual overhead
- Writing clean, maintainable code that others can understand

## Current Projects

### Multi-Tenant Data Platform
Building a Harness-inspired platform with workspace management, team-based GCP project scoping, and customizable dashboards. Built with Next.js, shadcn-ui, and BigQuery as a metadata store.

**Tech:** Next.js, TypeScript, shadcn-ui, BigQuery, Terraform

### OAuth-Authenticated Analytics Application
Developed a Streamlit application for Google Cloud's Conversational Analytics API with per-user BigQuery permissions and secure authentication flows.

**Tech:** Python, Streamlit, FastAPI, BigQuery, Cloud Run

### Automated Infrastructure Provisioning
Created modular Terraform configurations for BigQuery Analytics Hub, managing data exchanges, listings, and cross-project resources with proper data governance controls.

**Tech:** Terraform, Google Cloud, BigQuery, Analytics Hub
