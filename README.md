# Hi, I'm Ramakrishna Chavali 👋

Data Engineer specializing in Google Cloud Platform and modern data infrastructure. I build scalable data platforms, analytics applications, and automated pipelines that bridge the gap between data engineering and full-stack development.

## About Me

I'm a data engineer with deep expertise in Google Cloud Platform, currently transitioning into full-stack development to build end-to-end data products. My focus is on creating production-ready systems that are both technically robust and user-friendly.

**What drives me:**
- Building elegant solutions to complex data problems
